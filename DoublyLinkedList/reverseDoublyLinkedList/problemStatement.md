Problem statement
You are given a doubly-linked list of size 'N', consisting of positive integers. Now your task is to reverse it and return the head of the modified list.

Note:
A doubly linked list is a kind of linked list that is bidirectional, meaning it can be traversed in both forward and backward directions.
Example:

Input: 
4
4 3 2 1

This means you have been given doubly linked list of size 4 = 4 <-> 3 <-> 2 <-> 1.

Output: 
1 2 3 4

This means after reversing the doubly linked list it becomes 1 <-> 2 <-> 3 <-> 4.

Sample Input 1 :
8
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 
Sample Output 1 :
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
Explanation for sample output 1
Input: 1 <-> 2 <-> 3 <-> 4 <-> 5 <-> 6 <-> 7 <-> 8
Output: 8 <-> 7 <-> 6 <-> 5 <-> 4 <-> 3 <-> 2 <-> 1
Explanation: It's self explanatory.
